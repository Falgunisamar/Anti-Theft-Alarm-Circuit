# Anti-Theft-Alarm-Circuit
Creating an anti-theft alarm circuit typically involves using a combination of sensors, such as a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor and a buzzer. 
Hardware Components:

Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
PIR Sensor
Buzzer
Resistors
Breadboard and jumper wires

You can use this anti-theft alarm circuit to thwart burglary. It sounds like an alarm when someone tries to intrude into your home or office by hitting, pushing, or knocking on the door.
